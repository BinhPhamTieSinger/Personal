### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, instance-based, non-parametric machine learning algorithm that is widely used for both classification and regression problems. In KNN, the output for a given query point is determined by looking at the `k` closest training examples in the feature space. It is based on the principle that similar data points are likely to have similar outputs.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Instance-based learning**: KNN doesn't explicitly learn a model during training. Instead, it stores the entire training dataset and uses it during the prediction phase.
- **Distance Metric**: KNN relies on measuring the distance between data points. Commonly used distance metrics include:
  - **Euclidean Distance**: Used when the data is continuous and has no particular structure.
  - **Manhattan Distance**: Useful when the data represents absolute values in different directions.
  - **Minkowski Distance**: A generalization of both Euclidean and Manhattan distance.
- **K**: The number of nearest neighbors to consider for making a prediction. The value of `k` is a hyperparameter that you need to choose. If `k` is too small, the model may be too sensitive to noise (overfitting). If `k` is too large, the model may underfit and become too biased.

#### How KNN Works (Classification):
1. **Step 1**: Choose the value of `k` (the number of neighbors to consider).
2. **Step 2**: For a new point (query point), calculate the distance between the query point and all points in the training dataset.
3. **Step 3**: Sort the distances in ascending order and select the top `k` closest neighbors.
4. **Step 4**: Assign the most common label (in classification) or the average value (in regression) among the `k` neighbors as the prediction.

#### How KNN Works (Regression):
1. **Step 1**: Choose the value of `k` (the number of neighbors).
2. **Step 2**: For a new point (query point), calculate the distance between the query point and all points in the training dataset.
3. **Step 3**: Sort the distances and select the top `k` closest neighbors.
4. **Step 4**: Take the average (or weighted average) of the target values of these `k` neighbors and return that as the predicted output.

### Advantages of KNN:
1. **Simple to understand and implement**: It is easy to understand how KNN works, and it requires no training phase (instance-based learning).
2. **Versatility**: It can be used for both classification and regression tasks.
3. **Non-parametric**: KNN does not assume anything about the underlying data distribution (it’s non-parametric), so it can be used for data with complex relationships.
4. **Works well with smaller datasets**: It can work well on datasets where the decision boundary is very irregular.

### Disadvantages of KNN:
1. **Computationally expensive during prediction**: For every new prediction, KNN needs to calculate the distance between the query point and all the training points, which can be very slow for large datasets.
2. **Sensitive to irrelevant features**: KNN is highly sensitive to irrelevant or redundant features, which can degrade performance.
3. **Needs large memory**: Since the entire training set is stored, it requires significant memory, especially for large datasets.
4. **Curse of Dimensionality**: KNN’s performance degrades with high-dimensional data (i.e., as the number of features increases).

### Choosing the Right `k`:
- **Small `k` values (e.g., k=1)**: The model is more sensitive to noise and can overfit.
- **Large `k` values**: The model becomes more biased but more stable. It tends to smooth the decision boundary and may underfit if `k` is too large.

The optimal value of `k` can be found using techniques like cross-validation or through grid search.

### Algorithm for KNN:
1. **Initialize `k`**: Set the number of neighbors to consider.
2. **Distance Calculation**: For a given test point, calculate the distance between the test point and every other point in the training dataset.
3. **Sort**: Sort the training points based on their distance from the test point.
4. **Vote**: In the case of classification, select the most frequent label among the `k` nearest neighbors. For regression, compute the average of the target values of the `k` nearest neighbors.
5. **Return**: Return the predicted value (class or continuous value) as the output.
